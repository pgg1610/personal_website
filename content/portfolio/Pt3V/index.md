title: Origin of Electronic Modification of Platinum in a Pt-V Alloy
work:
- Electronic structure modulation
- Propane dehydrogenation

### Synopsis: 

Using experiment and theory to investigate the active site for propane dehydrogenation reaction. Alloying noble metals, platinum in this case, with another element (like vanadium) leads to changes in the catalytic performance which are explained by perturbation in the electronic and structural properties of the alloys as evidenced through multiple characterisation techniques and atomic-structure theory calculations.
