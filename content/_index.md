## About me
I am a Ph.D. candidate at [Davidson School of Chemical Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ChE) at Purdue University, advised by [Prof. Jeffrey Greeley](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ChE/people/ptProfile?resource_id=84163). My research focuses on investigating catalyst morphology and functioning alongwith modeling complex reaction pathways for energy-critical reactions. I work closely with experimentalist at the [Purdue Catalysis Center](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~catalyst/), and computational material scientists, aiming to develop data-driven insights using quantum-chemical calculations coupled with machine learning. 

Currently, I am part of a team investigating electro-catalysts to develop sustainable alternatives to fossil fuel resources for meeting future energy demands. We are working on developing deep-learning based methods to enable realistic description of catalyst surface and devise better sampling strategies to probe near-infinite combinatorial search space of possible candidates.

In addition, I am part of a team developing a free, web-based tool for evaluating the hazards and safety involved in a university-scale laboratory. This effort is part of [CISTAR](https://cistar.us/) consortium and jointly supervised by [Purdue Process Safety and Assurance Center (P2SAC)](https://engineering.purdue.edu/P2SAC)

Besides research, I am passionate about cooking, long-distance running, biking, and playing video games.
