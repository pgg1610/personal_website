## About me
I am a Ph.D. candidate at [Davidson School of Chemical Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ChE) at Purdue University, advised by [Prof. Jeffrey Greeley](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ChE/people/ptProfile?resource_id=84163). My research focus is investigation of catalyst morphology and functioning alongwith modeling complex reaction pathways using a combination of first-principles based quantum chemical and material-informatics methods. I work closely with experimentalist at the [Purdue Catalysis Center](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~catalyst/), and computational material scientists, aiming to develop data-driven insights using quantum mechanical calculations and machine learning. 

Currently, I am part of a team involved in identification of in-situ mechanisms for degradation and transformation of electro-catalysts, and the impact these transformations have on the catalytic activity. The primary focus is on energy-critical oxygen-cycle electrocatalytic reactions to develop sustainable alternatives to fossil fuel resoruces for meeting future energy demands. 

In addition, I am part of [CISTAR](https://cistar.us/) - an engineering research center, working on developing a free, web-based tool for evaluating the hazards and safety involved in a university-scale laboratory. This effort is supported by NSF as part of [CISTAR](https://cistar.us/) consortium and jointly supervised by [Purdue Process Safety and Assurance Center (P2SAC)](https://engineering.purdue.edu/P2SAC)

Besides research, I am passionate about cooking, long-distance running, biking, and playing video games.
